# Real_Estate_Price_Prediction - Banglore

This project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Bangalore based on location, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms.

## Technologies Used:
  â€¢ Python  
  â€¢ Pandas  
  â€¢ NumPy  
  â€¢ Scikit-learn  
  â€¢ Matplotlib  
  â€¢ Pickle  
  â€¢ JSON

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
  â€¢ banglore_home_prices_model.pickle â€“ Trained ML model  
  â€¢ columns.json â€“ List of features used in training  
  â€¢ pricePrediction.ipynb â€“ Jupyter Notebook with full code  
  â€¢ README.md â€“ Project documentation (this file)

## ðŸ“Š Main Features Used for Prediction
  â€¢ Total square feet (sqft)  
  â€¢ Number of bathrooms  
  â€¢ Number of bedrooms (BHK)  
  â€¢ Location (converted to one-hot encoded columns)

## ðŸ”„ Steps Followed
  1. Data loading and cleaning  
  2. Feature engineering (like extracting BHK from size)  
  3. Outlier detection and removal  
  4. One-hot encoding of location column  
  5. Model training using Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree  
  6. Cross-validation with ShuffleSplit and GridSearchCV  
  7. Saving model and columns for future predictions
